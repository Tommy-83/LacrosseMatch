## Inception:
* This project was created using Code Institute template from GitHub:
* In order to push this project from GitPod to Github I used a set of git commands on the terminal
* git status - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files
* git add . - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it
* git commit -m "message for commit" - Commits all the changes
* git push - Pushes all committed versions to GitHub

## Deployment on GitHub Pages:
* The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
* Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository
* At the top of repository click on "Settings"
* Once you are in settings scroll down to "GitHub Pages"
* Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch"
* After the page automatically refresh scroll down again on "GitHub Pages" and I will see live link to the published site.

## Cloning Repository:
* Local Clone
* Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository
* At the top of repository click on Code
* From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link
* Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone
* Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3

## Forking repo:
* By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
* At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on - - the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
* You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
